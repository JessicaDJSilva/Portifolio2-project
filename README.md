## The Big Bang Theory Memory game 
The memory game is a classic game made up of pieces that have a figure on one side. It was first mentioned in China in the 15th century and consisted of illustrated and duplicated cards. Each figure is repeated in two different cards.

To start the game, the pieces are placed with the figures facing down, so that they cannot be seen.

In the classic game, each participant must, in turn, turn over two pieces and let everyone see them. If the figures are the same, the participant must collect this pair and play again. If they are different pieces, they must be turned over again, and the turn is passed to the next participant.

In The Big Bang Theory Game, the player needs to find the 5 characters of the American tv series, the 10 cards are sorted randomly and when one match is found both images stay static on the user screen.
